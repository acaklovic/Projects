1. Sentiment_Analysis_Airline_Tweets (Big Data) 
   The research goal was to build machine learning models that classify tweets about airlines into the categories “positive” or “negative.” To do this, we created a corpus of common words from tweets about airlines and used Spark and Python to analyze the data. While constructing our models, we explored the data to learn about trends between variables, discover commonly used words in airline tweets, and learn which terms are important for determining sentiment. 

2. Text_Analysis_Fake_News.ipynb:
   Used text analysis and natural language processing to see if we could determine how credible a news source is. Our goal was to be able to correctly label “fake news” with our model with a relatively high level of accuracy. Additionally, we found the frequency of certain words associated with “fake news,” and sentiments associated with the words and with “fake news.”
   
3. GSPC_Time_Series_Analysis:
   Used data from a 20 year span (beginning Jan. 1997) to model a time series that was used to forecast closing values of ^GSPC in the last 10 months of 2017 (and then compared the forecasted values with the actual closing values).

4. Student_Performance_Analysis (Regression Analysis):
   The data interprets two schools in Portugal and looks at numerous variables which influence student performance in math. We examined how absences (a numerical predictor) affect a student’s performance in math. Using regression analysis, we tested the significance of categorical predictors, such as failures and traveltime, to see if they influence the final grades of a student.
